# ðŸ¦œ Dispute

Open source work in progress site similar to discord. Dispute currently supports servers and server creation, channels and channel creation, and messages.
Dispute uses Firebase to store data and authenticate.

Need help? Join the main Dispute server with code  dispute-app.web.app/servers?X6!uo1vX?ZAB

## To Use:
Download code as zip (or clone) and extract (if zip).
Open public/index.html (public/servers.html will redirect to auth), and create an account/login.
That's it.
