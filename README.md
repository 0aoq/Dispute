# ðŸ¦œ Dispute

Dispute is an open source, realtime messaging service that supports messaging within servers/channels, as well as direct messages with users.

Dispute uses open source projects, such as the following to operate properly.
- [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) (see line 32 of [app.html](https://github.com/0aoq/Dispute/blob/main/public/app.html))
- [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) (/src/purify.min.js, see line 33 [app.html](https://github.com/0aoq/Dispute/blob/main/public/app.html))

Dispute uses firebase for data storage. Firebase is NOT open source, and can be found at https://firebase.google.com
Dispute is hosted on firebase hosting, which allows for google trackers. Please host yourself on a localhost if you want to minimize trackers.

The main Dispute server may change with changes to how data is stored for servers.
